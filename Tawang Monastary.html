            The name "Tawang" is derived from two Tibetan words: "Ta" meaning horse and "Wang" meaning chosen. Therefore, Tawang translates to "Chosen Horse" in Tibetan. The name is believed to have been given in reference to the horse that Merak Lama Lodre Gyatso, the founder of Tawang Monastery, rode when he arrived at the location to establish the monastery in the 17th century.The choice of the name "Tawang" might also carry symbolic or religious significance within the context of Tibetan Buddhism, as names often have specific meanings or associations in Tibetan culture. The name has become iconic, representing not just the monastery but also the town and the broader Tawang district in Arunachal Pradesh, India.

                Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, becoming the Buddha. In Buddhism, enlightenment is the ultimate goal, and the Buddha is considered someone who has awakened to the true nature of reality.In Buddhism, the focus is on the Three Jewels or Three Refuges: Buddha (the enlightened one), Dharma (the teachings), and Sangha (the community of followers). These are the central elements of Buddhist devotion. Siddhartha Gautama, commonly known as the Buddha, as a god. Instead, Buddhism emphasizes that Siddhartha Gautama was a human being who achieved enlightenment through his own efforts and insight. The Buddha is often regarded as a supremely awakened teacher and guide rather than a deity.
