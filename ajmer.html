            About Ajmer
        </h2>
        <p>
            Ajmer is venerated as a sacred place for Muslim worshippers. The Dargah Sharif is the burial place of great Sufi saint Khwaja Moin-Ud-Din Chishti, who died in 1235 at the foot of a barren hill. The saint’s marble mausoleum is India’s most significant shrines for Muslim devotees. The pilgrim place receives an endless flow of followers every year and has been synonyms to religious enlightenment not only for Muslims, but also for the people of every caste, religion and creed.

        <p>
            Moinuddin Chishti was a 13th-century Sufi saint and philosopher. Born in Sanjar (of modern-day Iran), or in Sijistan, he arrived in Delhi during the reign of the Sultan Iltutmish (d. 1236). Moinuddin moved from Delhi to Ajmer shortly thereafter, at which point he became increasingly influenced by the writings of the famous Sunni Hanbali scholar and mystic ʿAbdallāh Anṣārī , whose famous work on the lives of the early Islamic saints, the Ṭabāqāt al-ṣūfiyya, may have played a role in shaping Moinuddin's worldview.   Moinuiddin acquired the reputation of being a charismatic and compassionate spiritual preacher and teacher; and biographical accounts of his life written after his death report that he received the gifts of many "spiritual marvels (karāmāt), such as miraculous travel, clairvoyance, and visions of angels" in these years of his life.Moinuddin seems to have been unanimously regarded as a great saint after his passing. The tomb (dargāh) of Muʿīn al-Dīn became a deeply venerated site in the century following the preacher's death in March 1236. Honoured by members of all social classes, the tomb was treated with great respect by the era's most important Sunni rulers. The 13th-century Sultan of Delhi Iltutmish paid a famous visit to the tomb in 1232 to commemorate the memory of the saint. In a similar way, the later Mughal Emperor Akbar  visited the shrine no less than fourteen times during his reign. He also made a pilgrimage to this tomb in 1566, with his Hindu consort, Mariam-uz-Zamani barefoot in the hopes of having sons born to them. He also reconstructed the tomb's sanctum sanctorum in 1579. Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Jahanara later renovated the structure.An elegant covering over the dargah was constructed in 1800 by the Maharaja of Baroda.

        <h2>Architecture of  Ajmer Sharif Dargah </h2>
        <p>
            The white marble dome of Chishti's shrine, as seen today, was built in 1532. This date is inscribed in golden letters on the Northern wall of the dargah. It is an example of Indo-Islamic architecture and the dome features a lotus and a crown of gold, donated by Rampur's Nawab Haider Ali Khan. It is located in the Ihaata Noorani (transl. Quarter of Light) of the complex. Materials used to build it include marble, brick and sandstone. The dargah has a royal darbar, Mehfil Khana, that was constructed in 1888. It is a square structure and has a patterned ceiling. Jahanara Begum donated the dargah's left facet (Begumi Dalaan),the railing around the dargah and also constructed a small platform, the Begumi Chabutra. The sanctum of the dargah has two doors. The canopy made of mother-of-pearl and silver was commissioned by Jahangir and is visible from the cenotaph's four silver posts.The ceiling is etched with gold and in 1888, the walls were gilded.The complex has multiple structures and has eight entrance gates.only three of these are in use. The Nizam Gate, a yellow structure with floral designs, is the main gate and was donated by the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan in 1911. An older gate, the Shahjahani Gate, was donated by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. It marked the expansion of the shrine complex beyond the Buland Darwaza, built by Sultan Mahmud Khalji. Other gates include the Madar Gate and the Delhi Gate. The Jannati Darwaza is a door made of silver that is used only on rare

        <p>
            The complex has eight tombs besides that of Chishti, belonging to members of his family. Some of these include Chishti's daughter Bibi Hafiza Jamal and Nizam Sikka, who was a water-carrier who saved Humayun's life.A huge chandelier, Sahn Chirag, was commissioned by Akbar. The Ahaat-e-Noor is a large courtyard where religious functions are held and qawwalis are sung.Near the Nizam Gate is the Naqqar Khana  where music was once played from to greet visitors. A large silver chandelier was donated by the Golden Temple. The Akbari Mosque is made of red sandstone and was probably commissioned by Akbar. A more elegant mosque was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1637.

                The Dargah is an impressive piece of ancient architecture. It is originally made up with simple marble tomb of Khwaja Moinnuddin Chishti with a golden dome. But slowly, it turned out in an enormous complex that houses various mosques, gateways and pavilions. In order to give this holy place a stunning look, numerous Mughal rulers like Shahjahan; Humayun contributed sumptuous offerings from time to time.

            <p>
                Before stepping inside the Dargah, one has to pass by the Dargah bazaar that leads to the main area of the shrine. The burial place of Sufi saint is enclosed by a silver railing and the divine marble dome arouses a feeling of peace and piety in an individual. In order to offer prayers to the saint, there are different sections for men and women. The separate room in which women pray was structured by great Mughal ruler Shahjahan’s daughter. A mosque stands within the Dargah that was framed by Shahjahan. This is an architectural marvel like all other monuments fabricated by emperor Shahjahan. The mosque is a fascinating structure wrapped in white marble with a narrow and long courtyard.

                One can also have a glance of worshippers who offer chaddar (a cover) at the Dargah. This chaddar is proffered as a sign of gratefulness to the venerated saint on the fulfillment of their desires. At the entombment of Sufi saint, followers also give rich offerings which comprise of incense sticks, jasmine flowers, sandalwood paste and that is known as ‘Nazrana’.

            <p>
                These perfumed offerings create an aroma that would leave a godly effect on your heart. One can also enjoy qawallis songs sung by qawwals in honor of the saint.

                At Ajmer Sharif, devotees of all age group are required to cover their head with a dupatta, scarf or even with a simple handkerchief.
