            About Nasik
        </h2>
        <p>
            Nashik (/ˈnɑːʃɪk/), Marathi: [naːʃik], formerly Nasik (listenⓘ))[13] is a city in the northern region of the Indian state of Maharashtra. Situated on the banks of the river Godavari, Nashik is the sixth largest city in Maharashtra after Pimpri-Chinchwad. The population of Nashik city is around 2.2 million and is emerging as one of the fastest-growing cities in India. Nashik is located about 165 km northeast of the state capital Mumbai, and about 210 km north from Pune. The Mumbai-Pune-Nashik region is called the "Golden Triangle of Maharashtra". With its high agricultural production, Nashik is dubbed the Napa Valley of India and the "Wine Capital of India" as more than half of India's vineyards and wineries are located here. Around 90% of all Indian wine comes from the Nashik Valley.[1][14] Nashik is one of the Hindu pilgrimage sites of the Kumbh Mela, which is held every 12 years.

          According to Hindu mythology, Vishnu dropped drops of amrita (the drink of immortality) at four places, while transporting it in a kumbha (pot). These four places, including Nashik, are identified as the present-day sites of the Kumbh Mela. The age of the Nashik-Trimbak Simhastha is uncertain, but its association with the kumbha myth is relatively recent, dating back to the 20th century. The Nasik District Gazetteer published during the 19th century does not mention the term "Kumbh Mela" to describe the local Simhastha fair.[1] The earliest extant texts that contain the name "Kumbha Mela" are Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh (1695 CE) and Chahar Gulshan (1789 CE). Both these texts use the term "Kumbh Mela" to describe only the Haridwar Kumbh Mela, although they mention the Simhastha fair at Nashik.[2] It appears that the Nashik Simhastha adapted the kumbh (and the name Kumbh Mela) from the Haridwar Kumbh Mela.[3] The Ujjain Simhastha, in turn, is an adaptation of the Nashik-Trimbak Simhastha: it began in the 18th century, when the Maratha ruler Ranoji Shinde invited ascetics from Nashik to Ujjain for a local festival.[4] As per Shiv Puran, brihaspati (Jupiter) enters Singh Rashi (Leo) every 12 years. The Kumbh mela is organized for same occasion.

       <h2>About trimbakeshwar shiva temple</h2> 
       <p>
        The Shri Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple (श्री त्र्यंबकेश्वर ज्योतिर्लिंग मंदिर) is an ancient Hindu temple in the town of Trimbak, in the Trimbakeshwar tehsil in the Nashik District of Maharashtra, India, 28 km from the city of Nashik and 40 km from Nashik road.[1][2] It is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and is one of the twelve jyotirlingas where the Hindu genealogy registers at Trimbakeshwar, Maharashtra are kept. The origin of the sacred Godavari river is near Trimbak.[3]

Kusavarta kunda (sacred pond) in the temple premises, built by Shrimant Sardar Raosaheb Parnerkar who was the Fadnavis of Indore State, is the source of the Godavari River, the second longest river in India. A bust of Sardar Fadnavis and his wife can be seen on the edge of the kunda. The current temple was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao after it was destroyed by Mughal ruler Aurangzeb.[4]

It was built by Chitrarao Khatav, a landholder of Khatav in Satara in 1696havrao and was repaired by Gopikabai, the mother of Madhavrao the fourth Peshva. Peoples bring ashes of their deceased relatives and immerse it in Asthivilay kund. Ashes of big personalities like Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Y B Chavan and others had been immersed at Ramkund</p>
        <h2>About Lord Shiva </h2>
        <ul>
            <p>
               Shiva is known as The Destroyer within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity which also includes Brahma and Vishnu. In the Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe.the Sanskrit word "śiva" (Devanagari: शिव, also transliterated as shiva) means "auspicious, propitious, gracious, benign, kind, benevolent, friendly". The root words of śiva in folk etymology are śī which means "in whom all things lie, pervasiveness" and va which means "embodiment of grace".

              Shiva's wife was Parvati, often incarnated as Kali and Durga. She was in fact a reincarnation of Sati (or Dakshayani), the daughter of the god Daksha. Daksha did not approve of Sati's marriage to Shiva and even went further and held a special sacrificial ceremony to all the gods except Shiva. Outraged at this slight, Sati threw herself on the sacrificial fire. Shiva reacted to this tragedy by creating two demons (Virabhadra and Rudrakali) from his hair who wreaked havoc on the ceremony and beheaded Daksha. The other gods appealed to Shiva to end the violence and, complying, he brought Daksha back to life but with the head of a ram (or goat). Sati was eventually reincarnated as Parvati in her next life and she re-married Shiva.  With Parvati, Shiva had a son, the god Ganesha. The boy was in fact created out of earth and clay to keep her company and protect her while Shiva went on his meditative wanderings.

                Jesus was Jewish,[10] born to Mary, wife of Joseph.[90] The Gospels of Matthew and Luke offer two accounts of his genealogy. Matthew traces Jesus' ancestry to Abraham through David.[91][92] Luke traces Jesus' ancestry through Adam to God.[93][94] The lists are identical between Abraham and David but differ radically from that point. Matthew has 27 generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has 42, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.[m][95] Various theories have been put forward to explain why the two genealogies are so different.[n]

            <p>
               However, Shiva returned one day and, finding the boy guarding the room where Parvati was bathing, he enquired who he was. Not believing the boy was his son, and thinking him an impudent beggar, Shiva called up the bhutaganas demons who fought the boy and eventually managed to distract him with the appearance of the beautiful Maya and, whilst he admired the beauty, they lopped off his head. At the commotion, Parvati rushed from her bath and screamed that her son had been killed. Realising his error, Shiva then sent for a new head with which to make the boy whole again but the nearest at hand was of an elephant. And so Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, was born. Other sons of Shiva are Skanda or Karttikeya, the god of war and Kuvera, the god of treasures.

<li>There are several important rituals that take place during the Kumbh Mela, such as bathing in the holy rivers, religious processions, ceremonies, and darshan with spiritual leaders.</li>
<li>The important rituals conducted during the Kumbh Mela include having a sacred dip in the holy river, religious discussions, mass-feeding the poor and women along with devotional singing. There are lively debates on religious doctrines as well. One can spot several yogis, sadhus and saints involved in the engagement of penance. Few of these yogis, come out of their caves in the majestic Himalayan mountains, only during the time of Maha Kumbh Mela. This auspicious process is known as 'blissful darhshan.'</li>
<li>The journey towards taking the holy dip in the sacred water is a spectacular sight. One can spot the Sadhus carrying bow, arrow and pennants. Few Sadhus are noted by their extravagant arrival, often on decorated chariots. Saffron is the uniform auspicious colour for this occasion. In a nutshell, the entire ambience is wrapped with spiritual sanctity and mysticism.</li>
